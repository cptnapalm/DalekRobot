DalekRobot
==========


This program was written for SMU's Spring 2014 KNW 2300 Class.
This program instructs our team's robot (designed and built by us) to navigate a course and accomplish a variety of tasks

The robot is controlled over a serial USB connection to an arduino. Using a modified version of the RXTXRobot Library, we implemented all of the automated functionality of the robot.
In addition to the required functionality, the program also includes a Graphical User Interface for testing and debugging.
